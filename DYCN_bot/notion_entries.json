  "topic": "German tax return",
  "summary": "This page shares an unofficial overview (not tax advice) of how 42 students might benefit from filing a German income tax return. If 42 is your **first education**, you can declare study-related costs (moving, commuting, books) as *special expenses (Sonderausgaben)*, which only matter if you earn above the basic tax-free amount. If it’s your **second education**, you can declare them as *income-related expenses (Werbungskosten)*, deductible from current or future income. You can use apps like Taxfix to simplify the process. The shared info is based on a Slack post by a student with tax consulting experience.",
